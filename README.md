# fpl-transfer-suggester

Fpl Transfer Suggester is a chrome extension that can be found here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fpl-transfer-suggester/ecnadffaomfmmddkbgkecknpgnlbdomj?hl=en.

To run call ng build and upload the created /dist folder into the chrome extensions developer area.

Best to output ng build into a folder elsewhere as not to always commit the dist folder! You can do this using the command 
ng build --output-path ../build --watch
